DevOps Flow 2019 - #1 Intro

# Why DevOps

	Automation
	Human<>Machine knowledge sharing
	Teamwork (Dev, Ops, QA, etc.)

# History 1
	ITIL - Great Britain, Tetcher, State As A Service. Бородатые мужики в свитерах работают долго: 5-7 лет т все ваши деньги. 
	DevOps

# History 2
	2009 John Allspaw (Ops) & Paul Hammond (Dev) @ Flickr - 10 Deploys Per Day Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr
	Dev VS Ops (Dev VS QA, etc.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6tWX48tmAo slideshare https://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/10-deploys-per-day-dev-and-ops-cooperation-at-flickr/10-Ops_job_is_NOT_to
	IT role transformation: Secondary Automate Well Known Processes -> Primary: Digital product, IT as a business.
	DevOps origins: Patrick Debois https://devops.com/the-origins-of-devops-whats-in-a-name/

# Why not DEV and OPS separately

	IT became a business itself instead of serving business.
	Time to Market
	ITIL efficiency assuming all above.

# Why DevOps - recap
	Enterprise processes automation: A => B. Straightforward long term strategy, B is well defined
	Agile: A => B? => B? => B!!! . Nobody knows what’s B, at the beginning. 

# Why DevOps? - Enterprise
	Main value of Computers - Business Processes Automation and efficiency
	Monolith, 3-tier software architecture
	OOP and Domain Driven Design
	Software helps the main product to interact with the market

# Why DO? - Agile
	Software itself interacts with the market
	Software IS a product

# Automation VS Digitalization
	Walkman VS Spotify example

# Convenient VS Digital products - examples
	Convenient: Drinks, Cars, Electricity, Food
	Digital: Airbnb, Uber, Monobank, Slack, Salesforce

# Convey Law
	# Company will inevitably produce the product with an internal structure that mirrors companies communication structure.

# Sum up
	# Software architecture drift to micro services
	# Complexity growth
	# Software quality degradation - we’re learning how to build digital products
	# Adjuvi Old vs new model of IT - use this picture

# DORA report examples - why DevOps matters?
	?????
	????

# WTF - Where’s DevOps here?
	Agile VS Corporate
	Values
	Process layer
	Methods/Practices layer
	Mention case with JS

# WTF - Where’s DevOps here?
	DevOps is an approach to produce digital products. To rephrase, it is not Who (engineer), it is What (Values, Practices, Methods)

# BI-modal IT
	Samurai - declarative and precise instructions
	Ninja - mastery and culture development

# What is DevOps - 3P
	Processes
	People
	Products

# DevOps  - infinite loop of DevOps (восьмерка)

# DevOps - the bridge between the Business and Delivery teams

# DevOps - cross-functional/full-stack teams 
	Th emotion of the Delivery Team

# What is DevOps - levels-based model
	CAMS Value (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Share Knowledge) - “Culture eats strategy for breakfast" 
	Process: Full-stack teams (devs, ops, qa, etc.), 2 pizza’s teams, Convey law, Agile Ops
	Practices: Infrastructure as Code, Source control, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, Continuous Monitoring, Config Management, etc.

# DevOps - Values level
	Culture
	Automation
	Measurement
	Sharing the Knowledge

# DevOps - Process level
	???? DevOps process

# DevOps - Base Principles
	Continuous Delivery - 
	Continuous Monitoring
	Everything as a Code (Infrastructure, Configs, Docs, etc.)

# Continuous Delivery
	Predictable delivery on demand
	Conveyer. Has value for every teammate involved into delivery. (Podjezd)
	Conveyer - image, roles, examples.

Continuous Delivery - Principles
	Repeatable and reliable delivery process
	Automate everything
	Everything in a Source Control
	Improvement by Repeating
	Feedback and retrospective actions
	Embedded Quality Control
	Definition of Done > Done === Released to prod
	Continuous Delivery Conveyer is a shared responsibility
	Continuous Improvements

Continuous Monitoring - Principles
	Monitoring as a service
	Centralized and traceable logs
	Visual Representation

Everything as Code - Principles
	Infrastructure as Code, stored in VCS
	Infrastructure Decomposition
	Infrastructure Code review
	Infrastructure Code testing

“Base, Service, App” DevOps model
	Base - OS, Windows, Linux, Runtime, Infrastructure As A Service (Cloud)
	Service - Webserver, Datasbase, Cache, Logging Infrastructure, Queues, Auth
	Application - our App’s code

World of DevOps - role examples
	Software Engineer with production infrastructure knowledge - writes app code, tests, monitoring and infrastructure code. JS, C#, Java, SRE.
	Infrastructure Engineer - write code for Infrastructure as a Service. Provides and maintains infrastructure for Developers. Kubernetes, Ansible Playbooks, Bash :)
	Infrastructure Services Engineer - writes infrastructure code and maintenance for specific platform services, such as: storage (MongoDB Replica Set), Monitoring (Prometheus as a service), Logging (ELK), etc.
	Release/Delivery Manager - manages the process of the product’s delivery, dependencies and integration.
