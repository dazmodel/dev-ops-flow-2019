# Agenda

* The origins of DevOps - the story behind.
* Traditional vs Digital products
* 3-Tier Monolith vs Microservices
* Structure of essential communication
* Organization structure and DevOps
* Core DevOps Practices
* DevOps roles - examples
* DevOps Flow 2019 - overview

# DevOps - Definition

DevOps is an organizational and cultural movement that aims to increase software delivery velocity, improve service reliability, and build shared ownership among software stakeholders.
It is not Who (engineer), it is What (Values, Processes, Practices).

* Automation
* Human to Machine knowledge sharing
* Teamwork (Dev, Ops, QA, etc.)
---
class: dp-regular

# DevOps - The Story Behind

* The need to standardise and optimize the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
* Huge demand to formalize SDLC
---
class: dp-regular

# Information Technology Infrastructure Library

* ITIL - ["Great Britain, State As A Service"](https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/british-politics/civil-service-reforms/).
* First attempt to take the challenge.
---
class: dp-regular

# The Origins of DevOps

* IT role transformation: Secondary Automate Well Known Processes -> Primary: Digital product, IT as a business.
* 2009 John Allspaw (Ops) & Paul Hammond (Dev) @ Flickr - ["10 Deploys Per Day Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6tWX48tmAo) ["slideshare"](https://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/10-deploys-per-day-dev-and-ops-cooperation-at-flickr/10-Ops_job_is_NOT_to)
* ["DevOps origins: Patrick Debois"](https://devops.com/the-origins-of-devops-whats-in-a-name)
---
class: dp-regular

# Why not DEV and OPS separately moving forward?

* Complexity of software increases in magnitude
* IT became a business itself instead of serving business.
* Time to Market
* ITIL efficiency is concerned assuming all the above.

# Why DevOps - recap

* Enterprise processes automation: A => B. Straightforward long term strategy, B is well defined
* Agile: A => B? => B? => B!!! . Nobody knows what’s B, at the beginning.
---
class: dp-regular

# Oldschool - "Traditional" SDLC

* Main value of Computers - Business Processes Automation and efficiency
* Monolith, 3-tier software architecture
* OOP and Domain Driven Design
* Software helps the main product to interact with the market
---
class: dp-regular

# Agile - "Digital" products

* Software itself interacts with the market
* Software IS a product
---
class: dp-regular

# Traditional/Physical VS Digital products - examples

* Traditional: Drinks, Cars, Electricity, Food
* Digital: Uber, Monobank, Slack, Salesforce, Airbnb
---
class: dp-regular

# Traditional vs Digital Companies - 3P Communication

* Processes
* People
* Products

# Convey Law

Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

# Interim Sun Up

* Software architecture drift to micro services
* Solutions Complexity Increases
* Software quality degradation - we’re learning how to build digital products

# DevOps Research And Assessment (DORA)

* Launched in 2016 by Gene Kim, Jez Humble and Dr. Nicole Forsgren
* The aim is to improve technology and organizational performance
* Prioritizing improvement efforts
* Attracting and retaining talent
* Establishing your brand as a high-performing organization

# DevOps - cross-functional/full-stack teams

* Scrum Guides: ["Development Team => Team"](https://scrumguide.uservoice.com/forums/241958-general/suggestions/36790429-rename-development-team-to-team-and-remove-sc)
* The notion of the Full-stack Team

---
class: dp-regular

# What is DevOps - levels-based model

* CAMS Value (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Share Knowledge) - “Culture eats strategy for breakfast"
* Process: Full-stack teams (devs, ops, qa, etc.), 2 pizza’s teams, Convey law, Agile Ops
* Practices: Infrastructure as Code, Source control, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, Continuous Monitoring, Config Management, etc.
---
class: dp-regular

# DevOps - Values level

* Culture
* Automation
* Measurement
* Sharing the Knowledge (Communication)
---
class: dp-regular

# DevOps - Process level

* Agile processes
* Infrastrucrture Platforms and Cloud Computing
* Automation Everywhere
* Continuous Improvements
---
class: dp-regular

# DevOps - Fundamental Practices

* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Monitoring
* Everything as a Code (Infrastructure, Configs, Docs, etc.)
---
class: dp-regular

# Continuous Delivery

* Predictable delivery on demand
* Delivery Pipeline. Has value for every teammate involved into delivery.
* Delivery Pipeline - image, roles, examples.
---
class: dp-regular

# Continuous Delivery - Principles
/// TBD: Add examples for each
* Repeatable and reliable delivery process
* Automate everything
* Everything in a Source Control
* Feedback and retrospective actions
* Embedded Quality Control
* Definition of Done > Done === Released to prod
* Continuous Delivery Conveyer is a shared responsibility
* Continuous Improvements
---
class: dp-regular

# Continuous Monitoring - Principles
/// TBD: Add examples for each
* Monitoring as a service
* Centralized and traceable logs
* Visual Representation
---
class: dp-regular

# Everything as Code - Principles

* Code Development and Collaboration practices everywhere
* Infrastructure as Code, stored in VCS
* Infrastructure Decomposition
---
class: dp-regular

# “Base, Service, App” DevOps model

* Base - OS, Windows, Linux, Runtime, Infrastructure As A Service (Cloud)
* Service - Webserver, Datasbase, Cache, Logging Infrastructure, Queues, Auth
* Application - our App’s code
---

DevOps is an approach to produce digital products. To rephrase, it is not Who (engineer), it is What (Values, Processes, Practices).

* etc.

---
class: dp-regular

# Release/Delivery Manager

---
class: dp-regular

# DevOps Flow 2019: Practices and Methods

* Modern Cloud Providers (EaC, Continuous Monitoring (CM)).
* CI/CD (Continuous Delivery (CD), CM).
* Configuration Management (EaC).
* Infrastructure Provisioning Tools (EaC, CM, CD).

Match to Infrastructure Engineer.
