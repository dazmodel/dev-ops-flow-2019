# DevOps - Definition

__DevOps__ is an organizational and cultural movement that aims to increase software __delivery velocity__, improve service __reliability__, and build __shared ownership__ among software stakeholders.
It is __not Who__ (engineer), it __is What__ (Values, Processes, Practices).

* Automation
* Human to Machine knowledge sharing
* Teamwork (Dev, Ops, QA, etc.)
---
class: dp-regular

# DevOps - The Story Behind

.left-column[
* If you need software - guess what? You need to build it somehow!
* The need to standardise and optimize the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
* Huge demand to formalize SDLC

# The Origins of DevOps

* IT role transformation: Automate Well Known Processes (Secondary role) -> Digital product, IT as a business (Primary role).
* 2009 John Allspaw (Ops) & Paul Hammond (Dev) @ Flickr - ["10 Deploys Per Day Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6tWX48tmAo) ["slideshare"](https://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/10-deploys-per-day-dev-and-ops-cooperation-at-flickr/10-Ops_job_is_NOT_to)

# IT Role - Enterprise and Traditionl Products

Enterprise processes automation: A => B. __The Idea__ remains the same, __details__ are subject to change. Straightforward long term strategy.

<div class="straight"></div>
---
class: dp-regular

# IT Role - Agile and Digital Products

Agile: A => B? => B? => B!!! . __The idea itself is a subject of transformation__.

<div class="agile"></div>
---
class: dp-regular

# Why Not DEV And OPS Separately Moving Forward?

* Complexity of software increases in magnitude
* IT became a business itself instead of serving business.
* Time to Market
* ITIL efficiency is concerned assuming all the above.

# Oldschool - "Traditional" SDLC

* Main value of Computers - Business Processes Automation and efficiency
* Monolith, 3-tier software architecture
* Waterfall, OOP and Domain Driven Design
* Software helps the main product to interact with the market
---
class: dp-regular

# Agile - "Digital" Products

* Software itself interacts with the market
* Software IS a product

# Traditional/Physical VS Digital Products - Examples

* Traditional: Drinks, Cars, Electricity, Food
* Digital: Uber, Monobank, Slack, Salesforce, Airbnb

# What Is DevOps - Levels-Based Model

* __CAMS Values__ (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Share Knowledge) - “Culture eats strategy for breakfast"
* __Principles:__ Full-stack teams (devs, ops, qa, etc.), 2 pizza’s teams, Convey law, Agile Ops
* __Practices:__ Infrastructure as Code, Source control, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, Continuous Monitoring, Config Management, etc.
---
class: dp-regular

# DevOps - Values Level. CAMS Values (WHY?)

* __C__ulture - (...) interaction of people and groups, driven by behavior. (...) there is a mutual understanding of others and their goals and responsibilities.
* __A__utomation - get rid of boring routine.
* __M__easurement - (...) taking a look at the entire operation and assessing it as a whole, not focusing on small parts.
* __S__haring the Knowledge (Communication)
